A REST API that allows clients to manage a pool of registered cars
under the SmartCar API and temporarily license them to accounts. 

Most modern cars are compatible with the SmartCar API, and CarGO allows the temporarily licensing of such cars so the renter can use them for a specific amount of time. This serves as the framework for any application that relies on the sharing of a single vehicle with multiple users.
